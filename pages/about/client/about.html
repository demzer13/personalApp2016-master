  <center>Thank you for using Brandeis Meal Buddies, a very convenient, hands-free app that allows you to quickly
    find a friend or friends to eat with on campus for a meal. Add people who you would like to eat with to your friends
    list by sending friend requests. Request a meal buddy by adding yourself to the meal buddies database. Simply specify your
    name, a dining time, and a dining place. Or, you can look at your friends who have already requested a meal buddy.
    Find someone who wants to dine at the same time and place as you, and voila! Say goodbye to asking each of your
    friends last minute over text or facebook messenger for lunch or dinner.
